      You
      won....... and not just like that...

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      No
      one has gone this far before you...

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      I
      know.

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      ... you
      are just kidding me, right?

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      You
      are just a very strong warrior who managed to reach the top of the tower!!

      Cain
      Mocker.

      Once upon a time, there was Cain Mocker, known for his sharp
      mind and even sharper tongue.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      You
      were a mage, exploring the secrets of dark magic and tempting fate with your
      daring experiments.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      Your
      sharp tongue and your luck made you famous among friends and enemies.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      And
      one day, in search of eternal life and power, you brought disaster to your
      hometown.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      You
      summoned a demon that you couldn''t control!

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      It
      was an accident, I made a mistake somewhere.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      I
      know.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      Your summoning
      coincided with a summoning on the other side of the world, where a truly sinister
      sorcerer lived.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      It
      so happened that the sorcerer on the other side spent all his power summoning
      the monster.

      And you "stole" it.

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      Oh.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      And
      seeing what you had done, you didn''t run away.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      Like
      many would have done.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      You
      killed that monster and died yourself.

      And your dream came true, you
      are practically immortal.

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      Yeah,
      not the kind of eternal life I wanted.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      Cain.
      You already understand everything.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      We
      are not going anywhere.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      We
      will stay. Because we had so much fun, didn''t we?

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      After
      all, how can I leave this place, I have to look after it.

      After this
      tower.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      My tower.

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      I
      suspected.

      But didn''t believe it!

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      So
      why are you here?

      My mistress.

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      I
      was bored and decided to check on my domain.

      --

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      I
      hope you are pleased with your faithful guide!

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      Of
      course.

      It was fun with you.'

      This is General Asterion.

      icon=Devil1_Sao2_3

      title=devil

      You
      are strong, no doubt about that.

      But I''m afraid neither your body nor
      your mind can withstand such a duel.

      icon=Boss_Minotaur1_normal

      title=asterion

      To
      what do I owe this meeting?

      --

      icon=Erza_Trick

      title=lachesis

      I
      wish to test you!
