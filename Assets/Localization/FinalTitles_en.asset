      You have overcome all the challenges
      and reached the end of the game Tower Of Nightmare. Your strength, perseverance,
      and skills have helped you overcome all the trials (that are available at the
      moment :)

      

      Thank you for playing and I wish you all the best.

      

      P.S.
      The game will be improved over time, with the story and various details being
      refined.

      And if the game becomes popular, there will be new content
      as well.'
